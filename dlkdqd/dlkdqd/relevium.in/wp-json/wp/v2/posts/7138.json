Having a balanced meal is very important in recovering from back pain. Having unnecessary calories can be converted into fat which can slow down the body&#8217;s recovery. Also, having a good protein intake is essential to help the soft tissues heal. And having a proper intake of fresh fruits and vegetables can further provide all the required vitamins and minerals for healing.<br \/>\u2022 <b>Gets proper sleep to support the healing process &#8211;<\/b> Getting appropriate sleep is important for physical as well as emotional recovery. One of the best ways to help you get good sleep is to include physical exercise in your routine. This can help you sleep better which would further aid to recovery.<\/li><li><b>Have controlled medication &#8211; <\/b>We know that medication could help in getting instant relief from back pain, but this is not the permanent solution. Pain killers are addictive and can also affect your mental and physical health, so it is important to consume these as little as possible. There are so many other ways that can help with physical pain like Physiotherapy, Chiropractic care, etc. These methods are proven to provide permanent recovery for intense and long-lasting pains.<\/li><li><b>Getting proper exercise &#8211; <\/b>Exercising is essential in any back pain, but it must be controlled and gradual and is best when there is professional assistance. Sometimes the cause of the pain could be a strain or muscle pull which could be treated with the help of professionals. You can also take professional help from Physiotherapists and Chiropractors, and at KKLINIKIN we have all these services available from the comfort of your home.<\/li><li><b>Stop smoking to improve oxygen flow to the spine &#8211;<\/b> We know the effects of smoking, but little do we know that it could catalyze back pain by disturbing the oxygen flow to the spine. So if you smoke, then it is necessary to quit smoking for better recovery from back pain.<\/li><\/ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-f86a9d9 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"f86a9d9\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-large\">Tips to maintain good posture and prevent back pain\n<\/h3>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-e309070 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"e309070\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Posture is the position in which you hold your body while sitting, standing, or sleeping.

Sit straight with the ears, shoulder, and hips aligned in a vertical line and while standing make sure that you are not leaning on one side.<br \/>\u2022 It is important to move frequently and to take regular breaks while working as sitting for a long time can cause strain in muscles and it also puts extra pressure on the back and neck.<br \/>\u2022 Use ergonomically designed chairs and props to make your work more comfortable.<br \/>\u2022 Become aware of postures and ergonomics in everyday settings.<br \/>\u2022 Exercise to prevent injury.<br \/>\u2022 Wear good, supportive, and comfortable footwear.<br \/>\u2022 Remember to include good postures and ergonomics in daily activities.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-584873c elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"584873c\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-large\">How to prevent aches and back pain while working on a computer<\/h3>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-d4820e4 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"d4820e4\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Most people spend maximum time in front of their computer screens these days, without even knowing its impact on their body. They stress their body by not maintaining a <a href=\"https:\/\/my.clevelandclinic.org\/health\/articles\/4290-low-back-pain-coping\">good posture<\/a>, sitting without any footrest, or extending their wrist too much. These practices can affect your muscles and create long-lasting pain. So, this has become very important to prevent back pain while working on computer.<\/p><p>\u2022 <b>Setting up a comfortable workstation &#8211;<\/b> We cannot deny that computer screens have become an essential part of our everyday work but by creating an ergonomically designed workstation we can reduce the level of stress it creates on the body.<\/p><p>\u2022 <b>Setting keyboard and mouse in the right position &#8211;<\/b> While setting up the mouse and keyboard, you must consider reducing unnecessary stress on your wrist, fingers, arm, and shoulders by keeping those in as relaxing a position as possible.<\/p><p>\u2022 <b>Position of the monitor &#8211;<\/b> The monitor must be positioned slightly below your eye level and should be at least an arm\u2019s distance from your face.<\/p><p>\u2022 <b>Position of the chair &#8211;<\/b> The position of the chair is very important to maintain a good posture and to prevent any back pain. The chair should support your back in an upright arch position.
