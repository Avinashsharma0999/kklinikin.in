This means cleaning the area and putting petroleum jelly on any skin sores to keep them warm. The treatment site is found with great accuracy, and the two sets of electrodes are placed so that the places where two currents meet are either right over or inside the lesion. The patient is informed that they may feel tingling, which should not be too uncomfortable.<\/p><p>A suitable IFT treatment frequency is selected and the intensity of the treatment is raised until the patient feels a moderate tingling. If motor stimulation is desired, the existing current should be adequate. After 15 minutes of therapy, it is common to change the settings on the machine and use a different frequency to get a different therapeutic effect, especially to reduce edema.<\/p><p>The present electrical current, when emitted, traverses the dermal layer and subsequently reaches the specific region responsible for inducing the sensation of pain. The stimulation of tissues resulting from the interference of the current elicits a sensation, which subsequently promotes an augmentation in blood circulation.
