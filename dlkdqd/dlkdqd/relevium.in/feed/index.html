									<p>When seeking treatment for back, shoulder, or ankle discomfort, it is common to undergo a specific procedure when seeing a physiotherapist for IFT (Interferential Therapy) physiotherapy. </p><p>The patient is in a comfortable position, and the skin is ready for low frequency treatment in the right way. This means cleaning the area and putting petroleum jelly on any skin sores to keep them warm. The treatment site is found with great accuracy, and the two sets of electrodes are placed so that the places where two currents meet are either right over or inside the lesion. The patient is informed that they may feel tingling, which should not be too uncomfortable.</p><p>A suitable IFT treatment frequency is selected and the intensity of the treatment is raised until the patient feels a moderate tingling. If motor stimulation is desired, the existing current should be adequate. After 15 minutes of therapy, it is common to change the settings on the machine and use a different frequency to get a different therapeutic effect, especially to reduce edema.</p><p>The present electrical current, when emitted, traverses the dermal layer and subsequently reaches the specific region responsible for inducing the sensation of pain. The stimulation of tissues resulting from the interference of the current elicits a sensation, which subsequently promotes an augmentation in blood circulation. This, in turn, triggers the activation of the self-healing mechanism. The non-invasive and successful nature of IFT makes it highly sought after for the treatment of back, shoulder, or <a href="https://KKLINIKIN.in/orthopedic-physiotherapy/">ankle pain</a>.</p>								</div>

									<p>Cervical Spondylosis is a broad word used to describe the degenerative changes that occur in the intervertebral discs of the cervical spine as a result of the natural aging process. Over the course of time, cartilage undergoes degeneration, resulting in the loss of volume and the development of dryness and cracks in intervertebral disks. As the intervertebral discs undergo dehydration and shrinkage, manifestations of osteoarthritis emerge, such as the formation of osteophytes, which are bony outgrowths along the periphery of bones. The condition is occasionally referred to as cervical arthritis or cervical osteoarthritis.</p><p>Cervical spondylosis is a prevalent condition that exhibits a progressive deterioration pattern as individuals advance in age. Cervical spondylosis affects a majority of those aged 60 and above, with a prevalence exceeding 85%.</p>								</div>

									<p><strong>1. Chiropractic treatment reduces neck and back discomfort</strong></p><p>Most people have neck and back pain at some point in their lives, especially as screen time has increased due to the use of smartphones and computers for work and other purposes, which promotes poor posture. A chiropractor might be able to lessen your pain by realigning your spine and relaxing your spinal muscles. Chiropractic care may be an effective option for conditions like sciatica than more invasive methods like surgery or pain injections.</p><p><strong>2. Chiropractic treatment reduces headache symptoms</strong></p><p>Chiropractic Treatment for tension headaches or headaches that come from your neck may be successful with spinal manipulation. It eases the surrounding soft tissues, which lessens pain.</p><p><strong>3. Chiropractic treatment aids with posture improvement</strong></p><p>Being treated by a chiropractor might be able to improve your posture, especially in today’s lifestyle which involves too much sitting and slouching. The Cobb angle (side-to-side distortion in the spine) of scoliosis patients may also be improved with chiropractic treatment.</p><p><strong>4. Chiropractors improve athletic performance</strong></p><p>Your joints may benefit from adjustments to improve your athletic performance. Myo fascial release and dry needling are both used to treat trigger points and mild muscle injuries brought on by sports training. Chiropractors alleviate joint flexibility issues, discomfort, and tissue stiffness, which enhances performance.</p><p><strong>5. Chiropractors improve Gut Health</strong></p><p>Do not let stomach issues affect how well you live. Chiropractic treatment &amp; therapy is a fantastic alternative regardless of the digestive issue you are having. It may relieve abdominal pain and bloating, flare-ups, help treat chronic constipation, and even lessen colic.</p>								</div>

While it was a terrific approach to get things running in Covid times from a technical and technological standpoint, one thing that is troubling us all separate from this Covid is the recent backache troubles people have experienced.</p><p>This has become a part of our everyday routines as a result of poor sitting postures and poor ergonomics. It&#8217;s one of the most frequent issues that can no longer be overlooked.</p><p>Do you know that almost 60% of the Indian population will have back discomfort at some point in their lives?

									<p>In layman&#8217;s terms, we commonly refer to age-related degenerative changes in our spine and other key joints such as knees, shoulders, and so on. Wear and tear on the spine causes disc herniation, which acts as a cushion or balloon, preventing two intervertebral bodies from colliding. </p><p>When a disc herniates, it causes pain and discomfort by impinging on the surrounding muscles and nerves. Furthermore, repetitive movements cause intervertebral bodies to clash, resulting in the production of osteophytes or bony prominences, which impinge on nerves, causing numbness, tingling, or paraesthesia.</p>								</div>

Check for tenderness, swelling, or bone deformities with palpitation. <br />2. Movement- to determine which movements trigger pain. In most cases, flexion or forward bending of the spine causes discomfort, whereas extension or back bending soothes it. <br />3. Motor weakness: The physio will ask the patient to perform certain movements such as straight leg raises, walking on their toes, or walking on their heels to check for muscle weakness. <br />4. Sensory examination- Last but not least, checking sensations, numbness, and reflexes is part of the investigation.</p>								</div>

									<p><strong>Patient education:</strong> patient education is one of the most critical aspects of any physiotherapy rehabilitation programme.

To improve the para spinal musculature, one must adhere to the rehab regimen diligently.</p><p><strong>Stretching exercises:</strong> in addition to strengthening the weak musculature around the spine, stretching the tight muscles of the opposing muscle group is also significant.</p><p><strong>• Hot and cold therapy:</strong> Heat therapy relieves pain by boosting blood circulation in the affected area. By supplying more oxygen to the damaged muscles, improved blood circulation aids in the removal of toxins that have accumulated around the areas. Cryotherapy, or cold therapy, on the other hand, helps to reduce inflammation linked with pain, allowing the patient to feel better and continue with their workout routine.</p><p><strong>• Electrical stimulation:</strong> Using a low to medium frequency electric current to stimulate blood circulation and remove toxic blood may help improve blood circulation and remove toxic blood as oxygen levels rise with fresh blood input. It also helps to relieve oedema and spasms in the para spinal musculature.</p><p><strong>• Posture correction:</strong> a weak core is a major contributor to back-related muscle issues, which must be addressed first.</p><p><strong>• Ergonomics:</strong> Adequate ergonomic measures are required at every job and should be taken seriously in our new corporate lifestyle.</p><p> </p>								</div>

									<ul><li><b>Eat well to help you heal &#8211;</b> Having a nutritious meal is important for any recovery from back pain as the healing process needs good care of the body. Having a balanced meal is very important in recovering from back pain. Having unnecessary calories can be converted into fat which can slow down the body&#8217;s recovery. Also, having a good protein intake is essential to help the soft tissues heal. And having a proper intake of fresh fruits and vegetables can further provide all the required vitamins and minerals for healing.<br />• <b>Gets proper sleep to support the healing process &#8211;</b> Getting appropriate sleep is important for physical as well as emotional recovery. One of the best ways to help you get good sleep is to include physical exercise in your routine. This can help you sleep better which would further aid to recovery.</li><li><b>Have controlled medication &#8211; </b>We know that medication could help in getting instant relief from back pain, but this is not the permanent solution.

There are so many other ways that can help with physical pain like Physiotherapy, Chiropractic care, etc. These methods are proven to provide permanent recovery for intense and long-lasting pains.</li><li><b>Getting proper exercise &#8211; </b>Exercising is essential in any back pain, but it must be controlled and gradual and is best when there is professional assistance. Sometimes the cause of the pain could be a strain or muscle pull which could be treated with the help of professionals. You can also take professional help from Physiotherapists and Chiropractors, and at KKLINIKIN we have all these services available from the comfort of your home.</li><li><b>Stop smoking to improve oxygen flow to the spine &#8211;</b> We know the effects of smoking, but little do we know that it could catalyze back pain by disturbing the oxygen flow to the spine.

Sit straight with the ears, shoulder, and hips aligned in a vertical line and while standing make sure that you are not leaning on one side.<br />• It is important to move frequently and to take regular breaks while working as sitting for a long time can cause strain in muscles and it also puts extra pressure on the back and neck.<br />• Use ergonomically designed chairs and props to make your work more comfortable.<br />• Become aware of postures and ergonomics in everyday settings.<br />• Exercise to prevent injury.<br />• Wear good, supportive, and comfortable footwear.<br />• Remember to include good postures and ergonomics in daily activities.</p>								</div>

These practices can affect your muscles and create long-lasting pain. So, this has become very important to prevent back pain while working on computer.</p><p>• <b>Setting up a comfortable workstation &#8211;</b> We cannot deny that computer screens have become an essential part of our everyday work but by creating an ergonomically designed workstation we can reduce the level of stress it creates on the body.</p><p>• <b>Setting keyboard and mouse in the right position &#8211;</b> While setting up the mouse and keyboard, you must consider reducing unnecessary stress on your wrist, fingers, arm, and shoulders by keeping those in as relaxing a position as possible.</p><p>• <b>Position of the monitor &#8211;</b> The monitor must be positioned slightly below your eye level and should be at least an arm’s distance from your face.</p><p>• <b>Position of the chair &#8211;</b> The position of the chair is very important to maintain a good posture and to prevent any back pain.
